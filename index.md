## Welcome to the Backdoors & Breaches Discord bot page!
***
### An Overview
Backdoors & Breaches is a role-playing game about incident response handling and offers a unique way to teach others the importance of practicing mindful habits when dealing with security-related incidents or training cybersecurity students taking part in competitions, and can be found in physical form on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y3Y1XLP/); more information can be found on the [Black Hills Information Security website](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/). This bot is meant to facilitate and automate most portions of the role-playing game while acting as a staging platform for tailoring the game to your needs. You'll be able to add custom cards and even play the competitive version by issuing a few simple commands! Overall, the goal of this project is to make the game more accessible to those who can't pick up a deck, or have trouble finding a group to play with; also, save the trees by having a digital deck rather than a paper one.

### The Rules
The '*casual*' rules can be found [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BB-Visual-Guide-PRINT.pdf) and the '*competitive*' rules can be found [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BB-Competitive-Version-Visual-Guide-PRINT.pdf). I'm curently implementing the casual ruleset in the Discord bot, however I have plans to include the competitive ruleset as an option in the future; more details will be placed on the repository's page when it becomes available. 

### The Implementation
As it sits currently, I'm planning to publicly host the bot so that any and all groups will be able to use the bot in their own Discord server for free without the necessary configuration of a hosting provider or script. You can [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=786455520873545759&permissions=469888081&scope=bot) the bot to your Discord server easily and get started gaming as soon as it's in and comfy! There may still be a few bugs to work out, but your patience is always appreciated and feedback more than welcome.

### Help!
A command cheat sheet isn't available yet since the bot hasn't been finished, but updates will come as soon as possible! If you're having issues with the bot, please feel free to submit an issue on the repository and I'll answer your query with the force of a thousand dying suns. I'm also fairly active in Discord when I'm not fighting fires, so feel free to shoot **Ursa#1337** a message anytime! In the meantime, while the bot is in development, if you have any ideas you'd like to see implemented, **please** don't be afraid to share! I'm not a creative person, and any crutch I can rely on for interesting solutions to problems people have is a major benefit to project growth (you'll also get a mention if the feature is implemented as thanks for your time).

### Thanks for your time!
Speaking of which, your time is valued and I want to say thank you for reading about this project. I hope it can help you and offer a great asset to the way you train others!
